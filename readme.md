# ðŸŽ„ advent-of-code solutions

These are my quick and dirty solutions to [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

## How to use it?

Prepare files for next puzzle:
```zsh
npm run next
```

Run the solution of the last puzzle:
```zsh
npm start
```

### Additional options

Both commands allow you to select the year and day:
```zsh
npm run next -- --year=2021 --day=23
npm start -- --year=2022 --day=23
```

You can run part 2 of the puzzle only:
```zsh
npm start -- --part=2
```

Or you can run it against test data only:
```zsh
npm start -- --test
```
